# ACX-tweaks
A browser extension that provides various small improvements to the [Astral Codex Ten](https://astralcodexten.substack.com) blog on [Substack](https://substack.com). It is currently compatible with Firefix and Chrome, though some pure CSS fixes can be applied to Safari.

## How to get
[Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/acx-tweaks/).

[Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/acx-tweaks/jdpghojhfigbpoeiadalafcmohaekglf). Works for anything that can use extensions from the Chrome Web Store, including Opera and Brave.

### Other platforms
If you're using Safari, you can get some of the pure CSS fixes [here](https://gist.github.com/Pycea/73eeee25ff4f697b76c0d3d36035c749). See the page for how to load them.

Under [releases](https://github.com/Pycea/ACX-tweaks/releases), you can get the source from the `chrome_src.zip` file under the latest release. You may be able to do something with this.
